NGUI2.XHelper
=============
something useful in development with NGUI2.x
include:
1.batch replace font,sprite,atlas with another one
2.batch delete component 
3.move a sprite in atlas A to atlas B,automatic change all the related prefab referencing to right atlas,of course you should set the working folder before.
4.9 patch slice tool,you can spilit sprite in atlas or just a texture
5.art font solution,easy to manage
6.widgets tool,easy to adjust the atlas depth,it will be banished in NGUI3.x
7.scan and record the sprite usage in atals, help you to eliminate the unused sprite
8.find the missing monobehaviour
9.remove all unused anmationClip asset;look up the anmationClip usage.


I will upgrade these tools to NGUI3.x in future
